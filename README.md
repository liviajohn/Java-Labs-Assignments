# Java-Labs-Assignments

**Lab 2**
Objective: Developed a program for a tiny convenience store that only sells bread and milk
Concept Summary:
1. Class design
2. Encapsulation

**Lab 3**
Objective: Created a program which allows the user to administer a quiz. A user will be able to add questions, remove questions and modify questions. In addition, a user will be able to take a quiz and get a score.
Concept Summary: 
1. ArrayLists and ArrayList methods
2. Classes
3. Methods
4. String methods

**Lab 4**
Objective: Created a software for the world's smallest bank. Bank can only have one customer. The customer will have a checking account and a savings account.
Concept Summary:
1. Inheritance
2. Over-riding methods
3. Instantiating objects
4. Fundamental Class Concepts

**Lab 5**
Objective: Objective: Developed a system that models a collection of library items using OOP. This system includes a driver program to manage the collection, allowing the addition of both Books and Periodicals into a unified array.
Concept Summary:
1. OOP Concepts
2. Abstract classes
3. Polymorphism

**Lab 6**
Objective: calculates Fibonacci numbers through two distinct approaches—iterative and formula-based
Concept Summary:
1. OOP Concepts
2. Interfaces

**Lab 7**
Objective: Deepened understanding of recursion through the implementation of three specific methods: recursive_multiply, recursive_div, and recursive_mod, all using recursive techniques. 
Concept Summary:
1. Recursion

**Assignment 1**
Objective: The code models US currency by creating classes for coins and notes, incorporating features to manage quantity, compute total value and weight (for coins), and handle adjustments in quantity, all while ensuring quantities do not fall below zero, and includes methods to present monetary amounts in a formatted string.

**Assignment 2**
Objective:  Tool for word guessing games by filtering a list of common English words to match specified letters or patterns, aiding users in strategizing for games like Wheel of Fortune by revealing potential word choices based on input criteria.

**Assignment 3**
Objective: Simulates the Pokémon encounter and capture process from Pokémon GO, allowing users to catch Pokémon using a combination of balls, berries, and throw techniques, and then stores the caught Pokémon in a Pokedex, all implemented through class inheritance, polymorphism, and user interactions.

**Assignment 4**
Objective: Implements an internationalized number guessing game that supports English, Spanish, French, and Simplified Chinese, leveraging object-oriented programming and polymorphism to display interface strings in the user-selected language, allowing multiple guesses until the correct number is identified.
